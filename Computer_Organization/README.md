#Computer Organization Programs

This folder contains ARM assembly programs written for Computer Organization 1 & 2 at MSU Denver.
Computer Organization is MSU's version of a hardware class. Some homework was assembly programs while most assignments were paper submissions. This is why the program assignment numbers aren't contiguous.

Since they were run and tested on the virtual CPU provided by Keil uVision they might not work in another environment.
Some programs have a few lines (commented out) that were kept for compatability with Arm Project Manager, which was being used by the school at the time and on school computers but would not work on my personal computer.

Note that the Hamming Code generator program was not written by me and was provided in class to generate Hamming codes to decode with the actual assignment, a Hamming code decoder.
