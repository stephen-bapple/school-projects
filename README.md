Work done for Computer Science B.S. at MSU Denver  (Non-exhaustive.)
Projects organized into folders by class.

This repository is intended to archive all projects completed at MSU Denver in the process of persuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
However, there are some projects that are omitted due to having been lost before I discovered Github, having been completed remotely through SSH, completed on a non-personal computer, and/or being purposefully omitted because the same assignment is still being used in class today.

If you are a professor and see something here I coded for you which you would rather not be publically available simply shoot me an email at stephen.bapple@gmail.com and I will take the code down. Although I would encourage you to instead modify your assignments since you can always keep improving them!
